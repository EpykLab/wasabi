    The Wazuh API is an open-source RESTful API that allows for interaction with the Wazuh manager from a web browser,
    command line tools like cURL or any script or program that can make web requests. The Wazuh WUI relies on this
    heavily and Wazuh’s goal is to accommodate complete remote management of the Wazuh infrastructure via the Wazuh WUI.
    Use the Wazuh API to easily perform everyday actions like adding an agent, restarting the manager(s) or agent(s)
    or looking up syscheck details.

    # Authentication

    Wazuh API endpoints require authentication to be used. Therefore, all calls must include a JSON Web Token.
    JWT is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting
    information between parties as a JSON object. Perform a call with `basicAuth` to `POST /security/user/authenticate`
    and obtain a JWT token to run any endpoint.

    JWT tokens have a default duration of 900 seconds. To change this value, you must perform a call with a valid
    JWT token to `PUT /security/config`. After this change, you will need to get a new JWT token as all previously
    issued tokens are revoked when any change is performed on security configuration.

    Login with USER and PASSWORD:

    `curl -u <USER>:<PASSWORD> -k -X POST "https://<HOST_IP>:55000/security/user/authenticate"`
    ```json
    {
        "data": {
            "token": "<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"
        },
        "error": 0
    }
    ```
    Use the token from the previous response to perform any endpoint request:

    `curl -k -X <METHOD> "https://<HOST_IP>:55000/<ENDPOINT>" -H  "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"`

    Change the token base duration:

    `curl -k -X PUT "https://<HOST_IP>:55000/security/config" -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"
    -d '{"auth_token_exp_timeout": <NEW_EXPIRE_TIME_IN_SECONDS>}'`

                      [APT38](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082) is a financially-motivated threat group that is backed by the North Korean regime. The group mainly targets banks and financial institutions and has targeted more than 16 organizations in at least 13 countries since at least 2014.(Citation: FireEye APT38 Oct 2018)

                      North Korean group definitions are known to have significant overlap, and the name [Lazarus Group](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0032) is known to encompass a broad range of activity. Some organizations use the name Lazarus Group to refer to any activity attributed to North Korea.(Citation: US-CERT HIDDEN COBRA June 2017) Some organizations track North Korean clusters or groups such as Bluenoroff,(Citation: Kaspersky Lazarus Under The Hood Blog 2017) [APT37](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0067), and [APT38](https://attack.mitre.org/groups/G0082) separately, while other organizations may track some activity associated with those group names by the name Lazarus Group

                    description: |-
                      Before compromising a victim, adversaries may gather information about the victim's networks that can be used during targeting. Information about networks may include a variety of details, including administrative data (ex: IP ranges, domain names, etc.) as well as specifics regarding its topology and operations.

                      Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct collection actions via [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595) or [Phishing for Information](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1598). Information about networks may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Search Open Technical Databases](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1596)).(Citation: WHOIS)(Citation: DNS Dumpster)(Citation: Circl Passive DNS) Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Active Scanning](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1595) or [Search Open Websites/Domains](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1593)), establishing operational resources (ex: [Acquire Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1583) or [Compromise Infrastructure](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1584)), and/or initial access (ex: [Trusted Relationship](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199)).
